# ToDo_List
The To-Do List Web App is a simple yet powerful productivity tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently manage daily tasks by adding, completing, and deleting items from a task list. The app uses the browser's localStorage to save tasks, ensuring that user data persists even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
